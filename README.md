# ClinGen Individual-Level Database 
The ClinGen-ILDB project is a "proof of concept" implementation of a federated database for sharing genotype and phenotype data. Motivated by the GA4GH Beacon project (https://genomicsandhealth.org/work-products-demonstration-projects/beacon-project-0), the ILDB is designed to allow ClinGen to execute a handful of meaningful queries against federated genetic datasets that are stored on Microsoft Azure cloud. 

### Funding acknowledgements
The ILDB POC was implemented and is made available under MIT license thanks to generous support from:
1. The Stanford/Baylor Clinical Genome Resource grant, awarded by the NHGRI (U01 HG007436-04)
2. Microsoft Genomics (with particular thanks to David Heckerman and Geralyn Miller).
