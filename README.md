# ClinGen Individual-Level Database 

The ClinGen-ILDB project is a "proof of concept" implementation of a federated database for sharing genotype and phenotype data. Motivated by the [GA4GH Beacon project]: (https://genomicsandhealth.org/work-products-demonstration-projects/beacon-project-0), the infrastructure is designed to allow ClinGen to execute a handful of meaningful queries against genetic datasets that are stored on Microsoft Azure cloud.
