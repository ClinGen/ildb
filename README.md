# CLEARNET Case Management Vault and Portal

The Clinbeacon repository contains two different projects, a case vault that's responsible for managing data for a tenant and processing requests from a centralized service, the hub project which is used for manaing the tenants or beacons in the system.

The projects rely on an OIDC provider for Authentication and Authorization. Azure Active Directory was used as the OIDC provider for managing users and access to the deployments.
